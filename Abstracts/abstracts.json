    "text": "Materials for future nuclear energy systems must operate under more extreme conditions than those in current Gen II or Gen III systems. These conditions include higher temperature, higher dpa, and more corrosive environments. This paper reviews some of the fuels and structural materials used in advanced nuclear energy systems and identifies promising candidates for these systems. Fuel systems includes metallic fuels for the sodium cooled reactor, TRISO-coated particle fuel for the high temperature gas reactor, molten salt reactor fuels, and accident tolerant fuels for light water reactors. Structural materials applications include the sodium fast reactor, lead fast reactor, high temperature gas reactor, molten salt reactor and extended life light water reactors. A final section focuses on plasma-facing and blanket materials for deuterium-tritium fusion reactors."

    "text": "Nuclear power currently provides about 13% of electrical power worldwide, and has emerged as a reliable baseload source of electricity. A number of materials challenges must be successfully resolved for nuclear energy to continue to make further improvements in reliability, safety and economics. The operating environment for materials in current and proposed future nuclear energy systems is summarized, along with a description of materials used for the main operating components. Materials challenges associated with power uprates and extensions of the operating lifetimes of reactors are described. The three major materials challenges for the current and next generation of water-cooled fission reactors are centered on two structural materials aging degradation issues (corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of structural materials and neutron-induced embrittlement of reactor pressure vessels), along with improved fuel system reliability and accident tolerance issues. The major corrosion and stress corrosion cracking degradation mechanisms for light-water reactors are reviewed. The materials degradation issues for the Zr alloy-clad UO2 fuel system currently utilized in the majority of commercial nuclear power plants are discussed for normal and off-normal operating conditions. Looking to proposed future (Generation IV) fission and fusion energy systems, there are five key bulk radiation degradation effects (low temperature radiation hardening and embrittlement; radiation-induced and -modified solute segregation and phase stability; irradiation creep; void swelling; and high-temperature helium embrittlement) and a multitude of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking effects (including irradiation-assisted phenomena) that can have a major impact on the performance of structural materials."

    "title": "Advances in quantum cryptography",
    "text": "Quantum cryptography is arguably the fastest growing area in quantum information science. Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regular basis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. In this paper, we provide both a general introduction and a state-of-the-art description of the recent advances in the field, both theoretical and experimental. We start by reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discrete variable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and protocols based on continuous-variable systems. We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point private communications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome these restrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantum cryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantum random number generators and quantum digital signatures.",

    "text": "The global financial meltdown of 2008 was triggered largely by overpriced residential property values. The US sub-prime mortgage market, large swathes of which had been bundled together or securitised in vehicles few outside the financial sector understood or kept a close eye on, was the first to blow.\n\nThe Irish property market, which had been bid up in value like the Dutch tulip, followed soon after, blowing a hole through the domestic banking sector and eventually through the sovereign via the infamous bank guarantee.This time around, the weak link in the global financial chain is not residential but commercial. That’s not to say we’re going see anything like what happened in 2008 – banks aren’t tied into property (commercial or residential) in the same way – but there is increased speculation that “stretched valuations” in the commercial sector have been found out by higher interest rates. And there is also the structural challenge of fewer people working in offices.\n\n“Amid the rapid tightening of monetary policy, global commercial real estate markets are particularly vulnerable due to concerns over stretched valuations and the increase in non-bank and international financing of the sector,” the Irish Central Bank noted in its latest Financial Stability Review."

    "text": "DNA cryptography is a new born cryptographic field emerged with the research of DNA computing, in which DNA is used as information carrier and the modern biological technology is used as implementation tool. The vast parallelism and extraordinary information density inherent in DNA molecules are explored for cryptographic purposes such as encryption, authentication, signature, and so on. In this paper, we briefly introduce the biological background of DNA cryptography and the principle of DNA computing, summarize the progress of DNA cryptographic research and several key problems, discuss the trend of DNA cryptography, and compare the status, security and application fields of DNA cryptography with those of traditional cryptography and quantum cryptography. It is pointed out that all the three kinds of cryptography have their own advantages and disadvantages and complement each other in future practical application. The current main difficulties of DNA cryptography are the absence of effective secure theory and simple realizable method. The main goal of the research of DNA cryptography is exploring characteristics of DNA molecule and reaction, establishing corresponding theories, discovering possible development directions, searching for simple methods of realizing DNA cryptography, and laying the basis for future development."

    "ref": "https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/abstract/1997/07000/a_brief_history_of_people_and_events_related_to.1.aspx",
    "text": "The events related to nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands began at the end of WWII when the U.S. began an initiative to determine the effect of nuclear weapons on naval vessels and on the performance of military personnel. The first tests took place in 1946 even though the area known as Micronesia was not entrusted to the U.S. by the United Nations until 1947. Beginning with the first relocation of the Bikini people to Rongerik Atoll in 1946, the saga of the Marshall Islands involvement in the atomic age began. Although the testing program was limited to the years 1946 through 1958, many of the consequences and events related to the testing program continued over the decades since. That story is still ongoing with programs currently underway to attempt to resettle previously displaced communities, remediate contaminated islands, and to settle claims of damages to individuals and communities. The history of the years subsequent to 1958 are a mixed chronicle of a few original scientific investigations aimed at understanding the coral atoll environment, continued surveillance of the acutely exposed Marshallese, some efforts at cleanup and remediation, numerous monitoring programs and many studies repeated either for credibility purposes, to satisfy international demands or because the changing state of knowledge of radiation protection has necessitated us to rethink earlier beliefs and conclusions about late health effects and social consequences. The objective of this paper is to briefly note many of the historical and political events, scientific studies, persons and publications from 1946 to the present that relate to atomic weapons testing in the Marshall Islands."

    "text": "This chapter presents nuclear magnetic resonance. High-resolution, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows powerful and applicable physicochemical techniques for the investigation of organic molecules. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy offers to carbohydrate chemists a method both for determining the configuration of unknown carbohydrates and for ascertaining the conformations of known carbohydrates in solution. This chapter represents no more than an interim report on the proton magnetic resonance studies of carbohydrates, because there are increased availability of instruments and the development of higher resolution spectrometers. The Boltzmann distribution of nuclei between the two energy-levels is a function of both the strength of the static magnetic field and of the temperature, and it results in a very small excess in the lower energy level. For continuous absorption of radio-frequency energy, the relaxation processes return nuclei to the lower energy level at least as rapidly as they are excited to the higher level. The screening constant depends on the chemical bonding of the proton, and the correlations are established between the electron distributions of compounds and their proton resonance frequencies."

    "text": "Nuclear reactor power systems could revolutionize space exploration and support human outpost on the Moon and Mars. This paper reviews current static and dynamic energy conversion technologies for use in space reactor power systems and provides estimates of the system’s net efficiency and specific power, and the specific area of the radiator. The suitable combinations of the energy conversion technologies and the nuclear reactors, classified based on the coolant type and cooling method, for best system performance and highest specific power, are also discussed. In addition, four space reactor power system concepts with both static and dynamic energy conversion are presented. These systems concepts are for nominal electrical powers up to 110 kWe and have no single point failures in reactor cooling, energy conversion and heat rejection. Two power systems employ liquid metal heat pipes cooled reactors, thermoelectric (TE) and alkali-metal thermal-to-electric conversion (AMTEC) units for converting the reactor power to electricity, and potassium heat pipes radiators. The third power system employs SiGe TE converters and a liquid metal cooled reactor, with a core divided into six identical sectors. Each sector has a separate energy conversion loop, a heat rejection loop, and a rubidium heat pipes radiator panel. The fourth power system has a gas cooled reactor, with a sectored core. Each of the three sectors in the core is coupled to a separate closed Brayton cycle (CBC) loop with He–Xe (40 g/mol) working fluid and a NaK-78 secondary loop, and two separate water heat pipes radiator panels."

    "text": "Cubic-meter-sized antineutrino detectors can be used to non intrusively, robustly, and automatically monitor and safeguard a wide variety of nuclear reactor types, including power reactors, research reactors, and plutonium production reactors. Since the antineutrino spectra and relative yields of fissioning isotopes depend on the isotopic composition of the core, changes in composition can be observed without ever directly accessing the core itself. Information from a modest-sized antineutrino detector, coupled with the well-understood principles that govern the core’s evolution in time, can be used to determine whether the reactor is being operated in an illegitimate way. A group at Sandia is currently constructing a 1m^3 \n antineutrino detector at the San Onofre reactor site in California to demonstrate these principles."

    "text": "Chemical warfare agents (CWA's) are defined as any chemical substance whose toxic properties are utilised to kill, injure or incapacitate an enemy in warfare and associated military operations. Chemical agents have been used in war since times immemorial, but their use reached a peak during World War I. During World War II only the Germans used them in the infamous gas chambers. Since then these have been intermittently used both in war and acts of terrorisms. Many countries have stockpiles of these agents. There has been a legislative effort worldwide to ban the use of CWA's under the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997. However the manufacture of these agents cannot be completely prohibited as some of them have potential industrial uses. Moreover despite the remedial measures taken so far and worldwide condemnation, the ease of manufacturing these agents and effectiveness during combat or small scale terrorist operations still make them a powerful weapon to reckon with. These agents are classified according to mechanism of toxicity in humans into blister agents, nerve agents, asphyxiants, choking agents and incapacitating/behavior altering agents. Some of these agents can be as devastating as a nuclear bomb. In addition to immediate injuries caused by chemical agents, some of them are associated with long term morbidities and psychological problems. In this review we will discuss briefly about the historical background, properties, manufacture techniques and industrial uses, mechanism of toxicity, clinical features of exposure and pharmacological management of casualties caused by chemical agents."

    "text": "Organophosphorous (OP) Nerve agents (NAs) are known as the deadliest chemical warfare agents. They are divided into two classes of G and V agents. Most of them are liquid at room temperature. NAs chemical structures and mechanisms of actions are similar to OP pesticides, but their toxicities are higher than these compounds. The main mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) resulting in accumulation of toxic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic junctions and thus induces muscarinic and nicotinic receptors stimulation. However, other mechanisms have recently been described. Central nervous system (CNS) depression particularly on respiratory and vasomotor centers may induce respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Intermediate syndrome after NAs exposure is less common than OP pesticides poisoning. There are four approaches to detect exposure to NAs in biological samples: (I) AChE activity measurement, (II) Determination of hydrolysis products in plasma and urine, (III) Fluoride reactivation of phosphylated binding sites and (IV) Mass spectrometric determination of cholinesterase adducts. The clinical manifestations are similar to OP pesticides poisoning, but with more severity and fatalities. The management should be started as soon as possible. The victims should immediately be removed from the field and treatment is commenced with auto-injector antidotes (atropine and oximes) such as MARK I kit. A 0.5% hypochlorite solution as well as novel products like M291 Resin kit, G117H and Phosphotriesterase isolated from soil bacterias, are now available for decontamination of NAs. Atropine and oximes are the well known antidotes that should be infused as clinically indicated. However, some new adjuvant and additional treatment such as magnesium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, gacyclidine, benactyzine, tezampanel, hemoperfusion, antioxidants and bioscavengers have recently been used for OP NAs poisoning."

    "ref": "https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.47.7",
    "text": "In this review we consider deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactors based on four different plasma-confinement and heating approaches: the tokamak, the theta-pinch, the magnetic-mirror, and the laser-pellet system. We begin with a discussion of the dynamics of reacting plasmas and basic considerations of reactor power balance. The essential plasma physical aspects of each system are summarized, and the main characteristics of the corresponding conceptual power plants are described. In tokamak reactors the plasma densities are about \n10\n20\n \nm\n−\n3\n, and the \nβ\n values (ratio of plasma pressure to confining magnetic pressure) are approximately 5%. Plasma burning times are of the order of 100-1000 sec. Large superconducting dc magnets furnish the toroidal magnetic field, and 2-m thick blankets and shields prevent heat deposition in the superconductor. Radially diffusing plasma is diverted away from the first wall by means of null singularities in the poloidal (or transverse) component of the confining magnetic field. The toroidal theta-pinch reactor has a much smaller minor diameter and a much larger major diameter, and operates on a 10-sec cycle with 0.1-sec burning pulses. It utilizes shock heating from high-voltage sources and adabatic-compression heating powered by low-voltage, pulsed cryogenic magnetic or inertial energy stores, outside the reactor core. The plasma has a density of about \n10\n22\n \nm\n−\n3\n and \nβ\n values of nearly unity. In the power balance of the reactor, direct-conversion energy obtained by expansion of the burning high-\nβ\n plasma against the containing magnetic field is an important factor. No divertor is necessary since neutral-gas flow cools and replaces the \"spent\" plasma between pulses. The open-ended mirror reactor uses both thermal conversion of neutron energy and direct conversion of end-loss plasma energy to dc electrical power. A fraction of this direct-convertor power is then fed back to the ioninjection system to sustain the reaction and maintain the plasma. The average ion energy is 600 keV, plasma diameter 6 m, and the plasma beta 85%. The power levels of the three magnetic-confinement devices are in the 500-2000 MWe range, with the exception of the mirror reactor, for which the output is approximately 200 MWe. In Laser-Pellet reactors, frozen D-T pellets are ignited in a cavity which absorbs the electromagnetic, charged particle, and neutron energy from the fusion reaction. The confinement is \"inertial,\" since the fusion reaction occurs during the disassembly of the heated pellet. A pellet-cavity unit would produce about 200 MWt in pulses with a repetition rate of the order of 10 \nsec\n−\n1\n. Such units could be clustered to give power plants with outputs in the range of 1000 MWe."
